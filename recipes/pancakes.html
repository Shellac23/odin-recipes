  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a tried-and-true favorite yet? <b>You're in luck!</b> The Allrecipes community can't get enough of these classic buttermilk pancakes. Reviewers say they're light, fluffy, moist, and full of rich flavor.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
       <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
       <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
       <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
       <li>½ cup milk</li>
       <li>3 eggs</li>
       <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
   </ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
       <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
       <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
       <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
       <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
